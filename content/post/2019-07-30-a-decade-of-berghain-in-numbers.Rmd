[Berghain](http://berghain.de/) is famous for many things. It's strict no photography and door policies (which you can take on, VR-style, via [berghaintrainer](https://berghaintrainer.com/)), fetish and gay roots, and raw industrial (ex-power plant) setting, for starters.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://live.staticflickr.com/4695/26100841668_e67a9effab_z.jpg")
```

It also sometimes puts on cool parties. What's cool is, Berghain's site still hosts their programming history on the site. This goes all the way [back to 2009](http://berghain.de/events/2009-12) (check Hudson Mohawke vs. Rustie on the WARP 20 night - I miss Rustie `r emo::ji("sad")`). There have been some neat projects taking advantage of this public archive, like [Artiom Dashinsky's piece](http://dashinsky.com/berghain-statistics/) which makes use of [Olle Holmberg's googlesheet collating 2009-2017 events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_OJHzKBwDFIK0YoLSX65g-jp_5djxx-9d4x1-LKUsw/edit#gid=1355724553), so I thought I'd dip back in to this premise.

I managed to pull listings from December 2009 through to July 2019 (at time of writing), now hosted in the aptly-named [berghain GitHub repo](https://github.com/ewenme/berghain).

```{r load-data}

events <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewenme/berghain/master/data/berghain-events.csv")

lineups <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewenme/berghain/master/data/berghain-lineups.csv")

event_lineups <- left_join(lineups, events, by = "event_url")

hot100 <- event_lineups %>% 
  count(artist_name) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(artist_name), !str_detect(artist_name, "cancelled")) %>% 
  top_n(100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```
