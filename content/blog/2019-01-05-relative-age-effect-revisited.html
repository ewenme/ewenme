<p>In football (and in other sports, in academia‚Ä¶probably other places, too), an interesting thing happens when you check out the birthdays of elite performers. Take a look at this graphic I put together last year, visualising birthdays of active English players in English football‚Äôs top four divisions (Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two) during the 2017/18 season:</p>

<p>This phenomenon is known as <strong>relative age effect</strong> (RAE). Participation in a given field is higher amongst those born closer to a cut-off date used to determine age cohorts for said field. One common example of a cut-off date is the academic year - two children born two days apart, but on either side of a school year cut-off date, will be allocated to different school cohorts. Furthermore, one of these kids will be possibly the oldest child relative to their peers, while the other could be the youngest of theirs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What unintended consequences could this cut-off have for the latter child‚Äôs future?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RAE has been popularised in a couple of high-profile books (both üíØ worth checking for), Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperFreakonomics">SuperFreakonomics</a> and Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">Outliers</a>. These examples centered on the birthdates of Canadian ice-hockey players, US Major League baseball players and European football (soccer) players. The latter case has also been <a href="http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/mr10_eng.pdf">given some shine</a> by the <em>CIES Football Observatory</em>. The viz at the beginning of this post attracted a decent chunk of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/83ejdw/relative_age_effect_in_english_footballers_your/">reddit</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ewen_/status/972426014738518016">twitter</a> fame. So, not only do I find this stuff interesting, I think other folks do‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To this end, what other stories about English footballer birthdays are there? Seeing as I already copped the data, might as well dive in.</p>

<h2>Is RAE diminishing (or mutating) over time?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/19/fa-plans-age-group-football">a Guardian article</a> which describes an FA plan to move the English football club age selection to run January to December (like much of the rest of Europe), rather than the existing September to August age selection. This was from 2011, quoting a <em>‚Äúhope to implement the changes for the 2013-14 season‚Äù</em>. I couldn‚Äôt find <em>anything</em> since to confirm whether or not this actually happened. The data might provide some clues.</p>
