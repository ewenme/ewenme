[Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club/) was launched last week by [Avalon Emerson](http://avalonemerson.com/) and a few other contributors (scroll down on the homepage for full *Credits*). You can share records or tracks with links to play and buy them from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/). Bandcamp is one of the more equitable platforms for indie artists and labels, so this project is a great way to broadcast great tunes and to support the artist directly.

I made a playlist of stuff that stuck with me this year, both the rough and the smooth. Check it out and cop the things u like. Love and thanks go out to all the artists.
