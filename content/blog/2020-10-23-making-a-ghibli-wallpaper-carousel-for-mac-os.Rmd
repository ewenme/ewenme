Studio Ghibli [dropped ~400 movie stills into the public domain](http://www.ghibli.jp/info/013344/) a couple of months ago. I turned this into a rotating wallpaper for my Mac, and thought I'd share the (tiny) process.

First, make a folder in which to store the images via a terminal session (then move to that directory with `cd`). N.B. edit the command below with a suitable file path for you.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
mkdir /Users/Ewen/Pictures/ghibli
cd /Users/Ewen/Pictures/ghibli/
```

Before initiating the d/l, you will need [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already, then install wget via `brew`.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
brew install wget
```

This next part is courtesy of a comment under the [HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24564775). I hadn't seen the curly braces `{}` trick before, which is a neat way to expand a numeric series in the shell. Anyway, this step will grab the whole image drop and will take a little while.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
wget --random-wait --timestamping http://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/{ged,chihiro,karigurashi,ponyo,kokurikozaka,marnie,kaguyahime,kazetachinu}{001..050}.jpg
```

All that's left to do is to work up the wallpaper carousel:

- open up System Preferences + click *Desktop and Screensaver*
- click the plus button on the left pane and add the new folder
- tick *Change Picture* and decide on a "change time"

Then, breath it in:
