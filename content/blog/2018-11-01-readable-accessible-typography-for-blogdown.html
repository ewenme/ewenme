<p>Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> makes building static websites with <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R markdown</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> very approachable. It’s also trivial to lift <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes</a> on to these sites (shouts to Emir Ribić for <a href="https://github.com/ribice/kiss">Kiss</a>, which this page is built with), and in turn create legitimately good-looking surroundings for R (or other) syntax.</p>
<p>Themes are mostly forces of good for technical blogs, given that beautiful web design is not a common trait of data sci types, but I must admit to modding the themes I like almost immediately. This is predominantly to avoid landing on a site that is indistinguishable from my own (which I imagine sparks a feeling of horror like realising your mate has the exact same brand new pencil case on the first day back at school). The first thing I usually hit upon is the <strong>typography</strong>.</p>

<p>If you, like me (prior enlightenment)…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>enjoy (or would enjoy) tweaking your Hugo site’s type</li>
<li>do #1 despite not <em>really</em> knowing what you’re meddling with when in and around <code>.css</code> files</li>
<li>do #1 despite also not <em>really</em> knowing what “good” UX is</li>
</ol>
<p>…then, this short post might help out. I mostly share some things I have found, written by people with actual credibility in these matters, to help my type tinkering avoid doing any damage (and possibly some good) for the folks reading at home.</p>
<div id="whats-your-typeface" class="section level2">
<h2>what’s your type(face)?</h2>
<p>The difference between a <em>typeface</em> and a <em>font</em> is a bit muddy, as far as I can tell (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface">blame Microsoft Word</a>, obviously). In short, the typeface name describes the shared design of a collection of characters. These characters can come in different sizes and/or weights (i.e. thickness) - such characteristics determine the font.</p>
<p>Before deciding on the typeface(s) for your site, stop what you’re doing and read Matthew Butterick’s <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a> (or, at the very least, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">Typography in ten minutes</a> and <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html">Summary of key rules</a>). As good a foundation (or deep study) of type as you make it. Be prepared to develop disdain for over-stylised hyperlinks and other things you were blissfully ignorant of before.</p>
<p>Pieces like Matthew’s tend to sit next to closed-source font families. You may not yet be into type enough to to part with $ for the promise of typesetting zen, especially if you’re coming from an open-source-software (OSS) first ethos. As far as open-source collections go, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is a common choice. Read <a href="https://design.google/library/choosing-web-fonts-beginners-guide/">Choosing Web Fonts: A Beginner’s Guide</a>, too, which asks some fundamental questions (e.g. how much text are you presenting on the page) to help you make a good type choice. It’s a bit self-selecting, as all of the typefaces are conveniently hosted on Google Fonts (and the article does a fine job of cramming in as many of them as possible). If you want to explore beyond Google, I will again refer you to some <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/free-fonts.html">Butterick</a>.</p>

<div id="work-work-work-work-work" class="section level2">
<h2>work, work, work, work, work</h2>
<p>What did I go for? Quick plug for <a href="http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/">Work Sans</a> by Wei Huang. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>contains “Extended Latin” characters (used in specific European languages)</li>
<li>optimised for on-screen, long-form text (a property of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif">sans serif</a> types)</li>
<li>includes a variety of font weights to handle different situations</li>
<li>made and maintained by an independent designer</li>
<li>is open-source</li>
</ul>
<p>As for font size, the body-text of my site is 16px. From <em>Typography in ten minutes</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In print, the most comfortable range for body text is 10–12 point. On the web, 15–25 pixels. Not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so be prepared to adjust as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/monospaced-fonts.html">don’t go using monospaced fonts for body text</a>…</p>
<p>I also use a grey (rather than black) body-text colour, which is okay on the web (but isn’t recommended for print) as screens have a greater contrast than paper and can be more tiring to read if this contrast is emphasised (i.e. black on white). Hope your eyes are appreciating this.</p>

<div id="the-blogdown-low-down" class="section level2">
<h2>the blogdown low-down</h2>
<p>If you use <code>blogdown</code> and have been inspired to get creative with type, but you’re not web development savvy, read the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/website-basics.html">Website Basics</a> section of Yihui, Amber and Alison’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a>. This will provide you with the basics of web dev and show you how to use this knowledge to customise Hugo themes.</p>
<p>To tamper with type, we mostly care about <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/css.html">Cascading Stylesheets</a> (CSS). For more on CSS, I will again direct you to Yihui et al’s wicked book instead of regurgitating the same messages less coherently. Also, <a href="http://mayagao.com/about/">Maya Gao</a> has made a really nice <a href="https://mayagao.github.io/css-quick-reference/">CSS quick reference site</a> you should remember to visit. Among other things, you’ll learn that your Hugo theme (found in the <code>/themes</code> folder of your site’s repository) usually stores CSS files in a <code>/static/css</code> sub-folder, where you can freely edit the complete look and feel of your site.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky (like me), your theme may have a dedicated custom CSS file for “entry-level” edits (e.g. header text colour) - make sure to read your theme’s documentation to find out. This is what mine looks like (source <a href="https://github.com/rbind/ewenme/blob/master/static/css/custom.css">here</a>).</p>
<pre class="css"><code>@import url(&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Work+Sans:300,400,700&amp;subset=latin-ext&#39;);
 
.content h1,
.content h2,
.content h3,
.content h4,
.content h5,
.content h6,
.title {
  font-family: &#39;Work Sans Bold&#39;, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  color:#222324;
}

.subtitle {
  font-family: &#39;Work Sans Light&#39;, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
}

body {
  font-family: &#39;Work Sans&#39;, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
}</code></pre>
<p>Quick breakdown of what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work Sans is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans?selection.family=Work+Sans:300,400,700">imported from Google Fonts</a> (note that the font load time will change if you import more/less font weights)</li>
<li>Headers and titles are given a heavier weight (bold) and darker colour</li>
<li>Subtitles are given a lighter weight</li>
<li>Body text is straight down the middle</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all - please don’t come for me, actual typography types.</p>
