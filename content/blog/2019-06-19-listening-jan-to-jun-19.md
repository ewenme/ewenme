Some of the records I have really appreeciated in "H1" 2019 are here. There's a [Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club/) list at the bottom to go buy the ones you like and support the artists behind them, too!

## Logic1000, LOGIC1000 *[SUMAC]*

Punchy and vibrant Aussie twists on UK funky rhythms, also featuring a slammin' [Niche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwO16Eg5NOc) rework.

## Shy One & Kwam, Spoons *[Astral Black]*

An ode to life, London and Wetherspoons, recorded in ONE DAY. Raw, relatable lyrics and cold productions.

## Budgie, Holy Ghost Zone *[Self-released]*

More effortless Gospel bounce according to Budgie. That's 685 – 689 Old Kent Road on the cover!

## Powder, Powder In Space *[Beats in Space]*

Powder goes into space and brings back only the freshest house, for your enjoyment.

## Sikka Rymes, Love Di People *[DUPPY GUN]*

Completely wild and essential performance from Sikka, perfectly complemented by bonkers Genesis Hull beats.

## Solange, When I Get Home *[Columbia]*

Playful, spiritual jazz and Houston-influenced vignettes forming a stunning patchwork to get fully lost in. 

## Dave, Psychodrama *[Neighbourhood]*

Powerful and difficult listening at times, but allways important and gravitational raps from Streatham's finest.

## Bézier, 府城 *[Honey Soundsystem]*

Tracks you can't put in a box, the result of a deeply moving and emotional recording process. 

## Anz, Invitation 2 Dance *[2 B Real]*


## Belter, Off The Meds *[Studio Barnhus]*

Hypnotic and intoxicating full debut from the Swedish-South African crew, does what it says on the tin. Joy kicks on from [81b](https://tossportal.bandcamp.com/album/81b) with party-mode remix business. 

## Afrikan Sciences, & The Kick Drum is Default *[Deepblak]*

## Tujiko Noriko, Kuro (OST) *[PAN]*

## Gila, Trench Tones *[Self-released]*

## Tierra Whack, All the singles *[Self-released]*
