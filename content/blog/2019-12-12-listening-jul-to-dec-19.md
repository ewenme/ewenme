Here is a list of stuff I was listening to in the last half of 2k19 that brought me joy. Check the [buymusic](https://buymusic.club/) list down below to pick up the ones available on Bandcamp. and directly support the artists. Then, go peep some [choice cuts from the first half of the year](https://ewen.io/2019/06/20/listening-jan-to-jun-19/), too :]

*Existential* by **AceMo** *[Self-released]* - Dude has not been playing around, insane output this year (along w/ serial collaborator MoMA Ready). Raw, spiritual Hi-Tech Jazz.

*Delusions* by **Akiko Haruna** *[Where To Now?]* - Deranged made vibey, somehow. The perfect dancefloor confuser.

*Hooch!* by **An-i, Anklepants, Epsilove & Ohlandy, Alexander Arpeggio & Marlene Stark, Umlaut!, Franz Scala** *[Sameheads]* - A proper mish mash of oddball jams from the Berlin crew. Umlaut!'s *Soap* is a percy, after-hours karaoke feels.

*Fanfara!* by **DJ Marcelle/Another Nice Mess** *[Laura Lies In]* - Marcelle goes deep and lovely, don't know how I missed her stuff until now but so so happy I found it (+ her [ace site](http://www.anothernicemess.com/index.html). 

*Cartas Na Manga* by **DJ Nigga Fox** *[Pr√≠ncipe]* - All the percussive gymnastics we've come to love, with plenty of surprises and new ideas from a Lisbon legend.

*Back to the Beginning* by **DJ Phil** *[Night Slugs]* - Ecstatic, 160 glitter-bomb of a 12". RIP DJ Rashad 4eva.

*MAGDALENE* by **FKA Twigs** *[Young Turks]* - A break-up record with Nico Jaar on the buttons? So nice to have Twigs back.

*Music X Road* by **Headie One** *[Relentless Records]* - Up there with *Drillers X Trappers* for me. Another big look for Mr. One.

*XYZ* by **Iglooghost, Kai Whiston & BABii** *[Gloo]* - Wonky bubblegum flavours from the future to make you smile (and feel dizzy).

*Jay Mita and Sisso meet the Modern Institute at the Villa* by **Jay Mitta, Modern Institute, Sisso, Errorsmith** *[Nyege Nyege Tapes]* - 

*GRIME MC* by **Jme** *[Boy Better Know]* - A victory lap for a national treasure, you'll have to work a bit harder than normal to find this one...

*5GTOUR* by **John T. Gast** *[Self-released]* - Made on a tablet on a plane, appaz.

*Slipping* by **Joy O** *[Hinge Finger]* - Probably Pete's most expansive and stylistically diverse work yet. Feels immediately personal and intimate, without sacrificing dancefloor sensibilities. 

*Lifetime* by **Klein** *[Ijn Inc.]* - Singular incarnations of black expressive styles, not for the faint-hearted.

*and departt from mono games* by **LOFT** *[Self-released]* - Fascinating jungle-ish, techno-ish club excursions from a well exciting new artist. 

*For You And I* by **Loraine James** *[Hyperdub]* - Can't remember a debut record that stopped me in my tracks like this one. Essential listening front-to-back.

*Dropped Out Sunshine* by **Madteo** *[DDS]* - It's your boy Madteo flippin' Drake and paying homage to ODB, some switch-up from the last full-length *Noi No* (on Sakho, a good six years back now!).

*Analog Fluids Of Sonic Black Holes* by **Moor Mother** *[Don Giovanni]* Devastating, explosive protest behemoths from Philly musician and poet Camae Ayewa.

*Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer* by **Oli XL** *[Bloom]* - Super sharp and promising debut album with lots of warmth and humour.

*Movimiento Para Cambio* by **Pelada** *[PAN]* - Meaningful and important club anthems out of Montreal, made to "inspire critical self- reflexivity through engagement, building power, demanding space and action". 

*Eve* by **Rapsody** *[Roc Nation]* - Another powerful and moving account of the world according to Rapsody, paying all respects due to amazing black women. Even manages to outshine J Cole on one joint...

*OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES Remix Album* by **SOPHIE** *[Transgressive Records]* - Exhilarating, mesmerising, intoxicating slalom through endlessly inventive twists on last year's LP.

*Parada* by **Serpente** *[ECSTATIC]* - More Lisbon drums, this time a nod to Prince's *Parade* LP. Utterly hypnotic.

*Ibiza Redux* by **Special Occasion** *[Jolly Discs]* - Cute and unassuming earworms, I could have picked anything out of Jolly Discs this year tbh.

*VORTEX* by **Special Request** *[Houndstooth]* - Woolford was not playing around with this one, to be played LOUD with friends.
