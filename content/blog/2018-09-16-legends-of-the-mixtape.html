<p>The modern definition of the hip-hop mixtape originates in hip-hop circles of the 2000s, now talking to an artist’s independently released projects that act as precursors to “official” full-lengths (albums). <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7669073/history-dj-drama-mixtape-evolution">In previous generations</a>, hip-hop mixtapes were more DJ-led and focused on ingenuity of “chops” and “blends”, but the DIY ethos prevailed through the shift towards MCs as main attraction. The dawn of mainstream streaming services and outgoing physical formats has challenged the identity of the mixtape somewhat, but understanding how the artform has reinvented itself around the current climate helps alleviate these concerns somewhat.</p>
<p>Traditionally speaking, the mixtape format means a couple of things. They are usually free, and subsequently avoid copyright issues usually associated with recording techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)">sampling</a> (a hip-hop beatmaker’s staple). This helps partly explain why some mixtapes have been accompanied by astonishing groundswells of support in spite of modest investment, why mixtape culture is spoken about in reverential terms and why it continues to be a medium for inspired work - the music is unashamedly open-source in attitude, both practically (transmission to fans i.e. for free) and philosophically (treatment of historic recordings).</p>
<p>You can actually see how this cultural phenomenon intersects with software development. Take <a href="https://glitch.com/about">Glitch’s about page</a>, specifically the use of the word “remix”, hinting that the act of a developer re-working an app (that someone else built and shared) is a bit like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD3lRLThVRY">Frank Ocean flipping a Coldplay sample</a>. (I’m aware that, beyond staring at computer screens in the dark, the developer-musician comparisons probably stop here).</p>

<p>Below, I toast some legends of the art and share the data/code behind the stories (carrying on the open-source legacy ofc).</p>
<div id="mixtapes-by-the-numbers" class="section level2">
<h2>Mixtapes by the numbers</h2>
<p>So, who was really putting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DawrlSwHUiM">Numbers On The Boards</a>, when it came to mixtapes? In truth, the ethereal nature of the beast and the multitude of ways the product reaches ears without much care for tracking (these are free and unattached to labels, remember) means that comprehensive mixtape statistics are hard to come by.</p>
<p>A good place to start is <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/">DatPiff</a>, probably the leading web service dedicated to hip-hop mixtapes. In the <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes/celebrated">celebrated section</a>, you can see download figures mapped to pre-eminent mixtape projects.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2018-09-16-legends-of-the-mixtape/datpiff-screenshot.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Through harvesting these figures comes a data-driven approach to uncovering who really runs the mixtape game. This comes with some caveats - mixtape streams are ignored (not readily obtainable for all listings), as well as tapes not available on DatPiff (or those that have been taken down). Still, a good idea of the state of play is in reach.</p>
