[Linear optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is all around us, even if we don't really know it. For example, how did you come to pick your route to work today? This decision, lovingly known as "getting from A to B", is (most of the time) objectively simple: **which route is the quickest?**

By knowing  the speed different modes of transports travel at, and the distance of each possible route, a journey time can be calculated. Constraints can also be considered - preferred modes of travel, less time walking, etc. - taking these parameters into account, a single best route can be attained.

## Gettin' in to a scrape

First up, I went straight to the Hardwax web shop to get hold of the review/description text accompanying releases on there. This would serve as the corpus of text from which we can build our Markov chain review generator. Here's what the release pages look like:

```{r site pic, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017-10-11-Meet_Dumb_Hardwax/hardwax_site.png")
```

[^fullcode]: To keep the post concise I don't show all of the code, especially code that generates figures. But you can find the full code [here](https://github.com/rbind/ewenme/blob/master/content/blog/2017-10-11-Meet_Dumb_Hardwax.Rmd).
