[Linear optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is all around us, even if we don't really know it. For example, how did you come to pick your route to work today? This decision, lovingly known as "getting from A to B", is (most of the time) objectively simple: **which route is the quickest?**

There are known variables that we need to identify and use in solving this problem (known as **decision variables**), for example:

- The speed at which different modes of transports travel
- The distance of each possible route

As anyone who has ever travelled anywhere will know, there are other parameters that we might want to factor in to a solution. We might prefer to avoid certain modes of transport outright, spend less time walking, etc. Often, linear optimization is used in business settings (not to knock anyone rocking it in their daily life), when there might be additional restrictions to consider - minimizing fuel consumption, or avoiding tolls. Any 'best route' can be reviewed to ensure these **constraints** are taken care of.

[^fullcode]: To keep the post concise I don't show all of the code, especially code that generates figures. But you can find the full code [here](https://github.com/rbind/ewenme/blob/master/content/blog/2017-10-11-Meet_Dumb_Hardwax.Rmd).
