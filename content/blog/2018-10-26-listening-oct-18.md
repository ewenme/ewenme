I used to write about new music. I missed it, so I'm going to try and post regularly about the stuff I've been feeling.

## $hit and $hine, Very High EP (on *Diagonal*) 

I bought this one on a solo trip to Rough Trade East, killing time before linking some friends at Genesis on Commercial St (PS I liked the staff outfits way more than the food there). Looks like your regulation handstamped white label from afar, but up close the type is no easier to read. I didn't know who made it 'til I got home and read up. Truly felt like the "very high" EP.

Not gonna lie, they had me with the [Steely Dan flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzrDs_Vaho4), let alone the [Ri-Ri sample](https://youtu.be/B3eAMGXFw1o). I played the A-side at the 'wrong' speed in the shop, but it worked on me - turned a 90-ish bpm R&B chugger into a springy funk jam and lent the vox that half-chipmunk effect (which I'm a sucker for). Some more voices (one amongst these is from [Road Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Wars_(TV_series), apparently?!) drift in and out of focus and freakiness throughout, with layers of distortion adding to the trip. Just about manages to stray on the right side of cheese, and fits right at home on Diagonal.

## Peverelist, IDLE050 (*Idle Hands*) 

Gripped on the same trip as the one above. I did feel a bit voyeuristic about this ode to [Idle Hands](https://idlehandsbristol.com/), a Bristol record shop I'm still yet to actually step inside. On the back of the record is a short story about how the shop came to be, penned by Joe Cowton AKA Kowton. Anyone who's followed him on twitter will immediately recognise the familiar humourous drole, but there's genuine warmth and inspiration here as he recounts the desperate times (feat. daily "stale cheese sandwiches") of Rooted Records (RIP) and brighter days feat. Sam Binga's fervorous painting skills (his bright green choice of 2011 has since been retired, unfortunately). He actually mentions punters at oversea gigs chatting glowingly about the shop having never visited, which helped me feel less creepy.

In keeping with the landmark catalogue number, Pev is in party mood on the a side, 'Left Hand'. Ravey piano stabs and percussive drive reminiscent of [Skull Disco](https://www.discogs.com/label/45565-Skull-Disco) era Shackleton are in full effect. This bounce reminds me a lot of [Dance Until The Police Come](https://www.discogs.com/Peverelist-Dance-Til-The-Police-Come/release/2801759), but the hums of paranoia and screwfaces are washed away and replaced with ear-to-ear smiles. On the flip, Pev really goes and 'Pevs' it - watertight drums drenched in subs. Sparse, distant, submerged. One to enjoy loud and in the dark.
