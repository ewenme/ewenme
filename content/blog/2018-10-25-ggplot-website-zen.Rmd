Yihui Xie's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package makes it relatively straightforward for people to build static websites with [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It's also trivial to apply any number of [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to these sites (shouts to Emir RibiÄ‡ for [kiss](https://github.com/ribice/kiss)) and generate legitimately good-looking surroundings for R syntax.

## ggplot
