<p>Last month I recorded a studio mix at home on the 1210s, the first volume of an occasional series for me to share sounds Iâ€™m bumping heavy. Iâ€™m calling it <em>bathing tapes</em> (donâ€™t @ me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigo">Nigo</a>), â€™cos most of the jams wonâ€™t sound out of place during an extended exfoliation session. but you should enjoy the soothing vibes wherever youâ€™re at. Find experimental techno diversions, Houston hip-hop, ethereal footwork waves, bleepy dancehall and more sweet infusions inside.</p>

<p>All credit and thank you to the creators of these tracks. Full tracklist over on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/3w3n/bathing-tapes-vol-one">soundcloud</a> ðŸ‘€ but some new artists in there you should go check forâ€¦ <a href="https://objectblue.carrd.co/">object blue</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cl_lit">Ciel</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wnkrs">DJ Python</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>This is something of a break from the usual content I have posted here. In 2017, I started this blog to write about and share examples of my work in data science/data sci-adjacent areas. The work of <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui</a> in creating <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> made it fun to share technical posts and give back to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> community, something I did with regularity last year.</p>
<p>This year, I have consciously put less pressure on myself to force through ideas (noticeable from the date of my last post), and Iâ€™ve dedicated more time on other crafts and passions, following creative thoughts naturally. I want to use this site to document all my creations, whatever the medium (and likely audience) and without hang-ups about the Personal Brand<sup>TM</sup>. So, tune in and tune out when it feels good ðŸŒŸ</p>
