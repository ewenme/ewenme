<p>Last month I recorded a studio mix, the first volume of an occasional series for sharing sounds Iâ€™m bumping. Iâ€™m calling it <em>bathing tapes</em> (donâ€™t sue me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigo">Nigo</a>), â€™cos most of the jams shouldnâ€™t sound out of place (or should enhance) if you so decide to give it a spin during an exfoliation session. If not, enjoy the soothing vibes inside wherever you find yourself.</p>

<p>Credit and thank you to all the creators of these tracks. Full tracklist over on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/3w3n/bathing-tapes-vol-one">soundcloud</a> but some new artists in there you should go check forâ€¦ <a href="https://objectblue.carrd.co/">object blue</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cl_lit">Ciel</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wnkrs">DJ Python</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>This is something of a break from the usual content I have posted here. In 2017, I started this blog to write about and share examples of my work in data science/data sci-adjacent areas. The work of <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui</a> in creating <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> made it a pleasure to share technical posts and give back to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> community, something I did with regularity last year.</p>
<p>This year, I have consciously put less pressure on myself to force through ideas (noticeable from the date of my last post), and during that time Iâ€™ve spent more time on other passions like the one above. I want to use this site to document my creations, whatever the medium (and likely audience) and without hang-ups about the Personal Brand<sup>TM</sup>. Tune in and tune out when it feels good ðŸŒŸ</p>
