At a cursory glance, it's almost impossible to get much of an understanding of vinyl record collections beyond their size (or perhaps their age, depending on the smell?). If you get up close, you might recognise some artist names or make out some titles on the spines of LPs, but your average collector is gonna have loads of bits that even *they* don't recognise on sight. Now, while the unadulterated excitement of finding a [white label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_label) on the shelve that even *you* can't remember is the romance at the very heart of record digging, that thought of forgotten artifacts would send archivists and librarians bonkers. 

Enter [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com) - the definitive recorded music database and marketplace, with over 8 million record entries and counting. Aside from catching themselves tumbling through all sorts of audio rabbit-holes, Discogs users are able to forensically catalog their own collection. Once you're at more than a few hundred records, having a well-kept digital archive of your music to refer to is sometimes the only way of knowing "did I already buy that record?", without having to leaf through the physical lot.

A user can browse through the individual pages of each of their records, but when the user wants to look at their overall collection they see something like this:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017-03-01-vinylspotting-discogs-fairytale/discogs-collection-page.png")
```

It's essentially a tabulated view of your collection with rudimentary info, and some record sleeve thumbnails to boot. The 'collection value' is a new (and very addictive) addition that, as far as I can tell, is the **only** summary statistic on show (besides the count), which got me thinking:

> If I've amassed hundreds (or thousand) of records, it would be cool to know a bit more about my collection beyond it's monetary worth.

The obvious next thought was, "[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) could probably help with that".

## Unpacking "it would be cool to know a bit more"

How does one take someones record collection metadata and translate it back visually, in a useful and coherent way?

A few concepts were prominent in my head-space:

* Part of what makes a record collection unique and special is how it **evolves over time**: it's not static and intakes distinct phases. I had to find a way to make this temporal element a central thread.
* Aside from insight about what's *in* their collection, something else that could be interpreted from the date records were added was **user's buying patterns.**
* The **on-rails-exploration experience of a Shiny app** seemed like a suitable environment to aid record collectors' discovery, essentially as **a natural, digital extension of the digging process.**
* The app should mirror the treasured and personal state of the subject matter. In keeping, the **language adopted should be idiosyncratic and approachable.**

## Introducing vinylSpotting

The resulting product is available for diggers everywhere (psst...if you ain't, try it out with my username *ewen_henderson*) over [here](https://apps.ewen.io/vinylspotting), with a tiny showcase below.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017-03-01-vinylspotting-discogs-fairytale/vinyspotting-preview.gif")
```

 Shiny's a hard thing to do justice to in markdown, so head straight over there to get a flavour and check the [github repo](https://github.com/ewenme/vinylspotting) if you want to see the Shiny code. Behind the scenes, *vinylSpotting* retrieves public Discogs collections via the [Discogs API v2.0](https://www.discogs.com/developers/) (sidenote - the data heavy lifting is all done by [discogger](https://github.com/ewenme/discogger), in case you want to use the Discogs API in your own project).

## To do's / limitations

There are some things that would be cool to incorporate into future iterations. The most glaring omission is any kind of spend analytics - unfortunately, Discogs don't offer up their marketplace sales data in the public API offering (though there has been previous for publications to get exclusive access (hint, hint)) so for now, it's off limits. Something that I chose to exclude was record's rating data (i.e. what the average rating for a record was), which felt like it could be noise in an app that would explore a single user's collection and, thus, would mostly contain records that person already rated highly (i.e. they bought it).

Also, the current measure of buying patterns, assuming that a record was bought at the time it was added to the site, is only as accurate as the users timeliness in pushing their new records to the site when they buy them. It may be that for some users who sit on a backlog of records and upload them to the site all at once, such proxies become highly skewed. Some words of caution to users about this in the UI may be appropriate.

With time, an interesting exercise could be to fit a time series model to user's collections to provide a forecast of the size of their collection in the future. The recently open-sourced [Prophet](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/) could be a suitably flexible procedure to implement in a Shiny app environment.
