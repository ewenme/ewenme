Ewen (like *you 'n'*). Interested in the fields of data science, technology, music, sound art, sport, culture, policy, and especially where any of these intersect. I like spending time with humane/ethical open source projects, DJing, running, supporting local artistic communities and sinking into a [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) rabbit-hole. This site is mostly for sharing stories about my diverse excursions in these spaces.
