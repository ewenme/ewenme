Last week, I put out a site â€” [GRIMENET](https://apps.ewen.io/grimenet/). There, it's possible for fans of UK Grime to explore how the scene works as a social network through collaborations on records. Hit the **?** icon in the app for a bit of background on the work and why I wanted to put this together.

Here's what it looks like...

If this interests you, go fill ur boots. The [code](https://github.com/ewenme/grimenet) + [data](https://github.com/ewenme/grime-archives) used is open-sourced, too, if you wanna go under the hood or create something yourself.
