The modern definition of the hip-hop mixtape originates in hip-hop circles of the 2000s, now talking to an artist's independently released projects that act as precursors to "official" full-lengths (albums). [In previous generations](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7669073/history-dj-drama-mixtape-evolution), hip-hop mixtapes were more DJ-led and focused on ingenuity of "chops" and "blends", but the DIY ethos prevailed through the shift towards MCs as main attraction. The dawn of mainstream streaming services and outgoing physical formats has challenged the identity of the mixtape somewhat, but understanding how the artform has reinvented itself around the current climate helps alleviate these concerns somewhat.

Traditionally speaking, the mixtape format means a couple of things. They are usually free, and subsequently avoid copyright issues usually associated with recording techniques like [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)) (a hip-hop beatmaker's staple). This helps partly explain why some mixtapes have been accompanied by astonishing groundswells of support in spite of modest investment, why mixtape culture is spoken about in reverential terms and why it continues to be a medium for inspired work - the music is unashamedly open-source in attitude, both practically (transmission to fans i.e. for free) and philosophically (treatment of historic recordings).

You can actually see how this cultural phenomenon intersects with software development. Take [Glitch's about page](https://glitch.com/about), specifically the use of the word "remix", hinting that the act of a developer re-working an app (that someone else built and shared) is a bit like [Frank Ocean flipping a Coldplay sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD3lRLThVRY). (I'm aware that, beyond staring at computer screens in the dark, the developer-musician comparisons probably stop here).

## Mixtapes by the numbers

So, who was really putting [Numbers On The Boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DawrlSwHUiM), when it came to mixtapes? In truth, the ethereal nature of the beast and the multitude of ways the product reaches ears without much care for tracking (these are free and unattached to labels, remember) means that comprehensive mixtape statistics are hard to come by.

A good place to start is [DatPiff](http://www.datpiff.com/), probably the leading web service dedicated to hip-hop mixtapes. In the [celebrated section](http://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes/celebrated), you can see download figures mapped to pre-eminent mixtape projects.

```{r out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2018-09-16-legends-of-the-mixtape/datpiff-screenshot.png")
```

Through harvesting these figures comes a data-driven approach to uncovering who really runs the mixtape game.[^data] This comes with some caveats - mixtape streams are ignored (not readily obtainable for all listings), as are tapes not available on DatPiff (or those that have been taken down). Still, a good idea of the state of play is in reach (PS the next one is best explored on a desktop browser, if you have one handy)...[^bubbles]

> As detailed in [Mike Bostock's bubble chart block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269), bubble charts aren't as perceptually accurate as bars. However, being less concerned with precise values means hundreds of values can be packed into the same chart area, which makes sense for this type of exploratory interactive.

## Weezy the `r emo::ji("goat")`

In case there was any doubt, Lil Wayne AKA Weezy AKA Tunechi comes out on top of DatPiff mixtape downloads, clocking in at ~18 million. This can be largely attributed to his infamous mixtape run of 2004-2008, encompassing both the *Da Drought* and *Dedication* series. Of the former, [#3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjGSyQU-YxQ) (2007) is widely regarded as the best of the bunch and fancied as the finest of it's class in critical circles. Your fave could never etc etc.

Honorable mentions to a few of my personal favourites (with helpful pointers to some best-in-class material):

- Gucci Mane (5.8 million): Put out a dozen mixtapes during a prolific 2008-2010 period. Check out [The Movie: Part 3 (Burrprint: 3D)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xpVLjvEPK4) (2009) first. BRRRRRR.
- Future (4.3 million): The master of twisted Bacchanalia rap, as hard-working as Gucci. Start off with [56 Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXXZ3J_QIGw) (2015).
- Chance the Rapper (2.8 million): [Acid Rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e67Q-sTHVhc) (2013) and [Coloring Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6C0dfq4ZWM) (2016) are dope and up-ended many expectations that independent artists and mixtapes were facing extinction.

I could go on, but why not head back to the interactive and explore some new music yourself `r emo::ji("peace")`
