      <title>Introducing geniusr</title>

      <description>I made a new R package (üî•üì¶üî•) this week. My sophomore post on this site (from way back in March) was a text-based analysis of Kanye West records, which exposed me to the Genius API1 once I wanted to get hold of some lyrical content. In the process, I wrote some functions for playing nicely with this API in R that I knew would probably be handy for others dabbling/wanting to dabble in similar matters.</description>

      <description>Shout-out to the Monday Morning Data Science mailout from John Hopkins. Making my way through this week‚Äôs (#41) edition, I hit upon quite the eulogy concerning a new R package:
 ‚ÄúThe most compelling data visualization libraries I‚Äôve seen in awhile‚Ä¶you have to see it to believe it‚Äù
 You had me at compelling (I‚Äôm not sure who had me exactly, this was the only entry w/o a name attached to it ü§î).</description>

      <title>My Linear(ish) Programming Fantasy</title>

      <description>Linear optimization (AKA linear programming) is all around us, even if we don‚Äôt really know it. For example, how did you come to pick your route to work today? This decision, lovingly known as ‚Äúgetting from A to B‚Äù, is (most of the time) objectively simple: which route is the quickest?
There are known variables that we need to identify and use in solving this problem (known as decision variables), for example:</description>

      <description>Twitter bots have gotten a fairly bad rap, recently (often with good reason). When they‚Äôre done right, a genuinely quirky robot can cut through a feed full of humans with beautiful tidbits. God bless [@tinycarebot](https://twitter.com/tinycarebot).
üíü: please dont forget to text back your friends ‚Äî here&#39;s your reminder (@tinycarebot) October 6, 2017   
Another thing that gives me life is reading Hardwax, a hugely influential Berlin record store, get excited about their new stock.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the European Football Transfer Window</title>

      <description>Followers of European football will be familiar with the infamous transfer window system, which endears clubs to buy and sell players in a specified period - once in the off-season (summer), and once at the turn of each calendar year. This constraint has invited increasingly peculiar and precarious market activity over the years, as clubs vie to secure the hottest new talents with varying parts method and madness. Meanwhile, fans lap up newspaper gossip columns and tell friends ‚Äúhe looks quality on YouTube‚Äù as they frantically research the latest ‚Äúwunderkind‚Äù their club has been linked with.</description>

      <title>Advocating for Open Policing with sparklyr and Shiny</title>

      <description>I don‚Äôt have much reason to dip in to big data processing tools in my current working capacity. Luckily for me, I have a (self-indulgent) blog now - perfect place to scratch these sorts of itches, and then share the resultant mishaps with the whole world.
I‚Äôd recently been working on a Shiny app for increasing visibility and engagement with police violence data. It just so happened that I stumbled across Stanford‚Äôs Open Policing Project, with some hefty open data ripe for exploring with big data tools, right after the app‚Äôs first build was finished.</description>

      <description>I recently authored my first R package (and definitely have the bug, now). It would be remiss of me to continue without a quick PSA for anyone out there thinking about dabbling in the package game - below is a shout-out of the invaluable resources I found along the way that kept me nice and sane.

      <title>Tracking London&#39;s Pub &amp; Bar Landscape with geofacet</title>

      <description>Introducing geofacet The geofacet package dropped recently (I want to say last week?), a ggplot2 extension allowing for the user to facet plots in a way that can retain an underlying geographical dimension. It perhaps goes a little bit further towards abstraction than tilegrams, but the visualizations we produce can be a bit more complex as well. This post documents my first foray into this packages functionality.1
 Getting to grips with grids If we think about faceting in ggplot2 (facet_wrap, facet_grid), we are already familiar with the idea of placing a sequence of plots into a number of panels, arranged according to a variable(s) of interest.</description>

      <title>The Representativeness of UK Parliament</title>

      <description>As a general election looms, a familiar UK media maelstrom has begun. The key difference here is that the public has been taken by surprise, somewhat - Theresa May‚Äôs call for a snap election (we weren‚Äôt actually due one until 2020) has left folk with little under two months to decide where their vote will go.
For some, this may be the first election they are able to participate in. For many, the traditional delivery of party politics might not have kept them engaged all that well since the last election.</description>

      <title>A Sentiment Analysis of Kanye West Records</title>

      <description>PSA: This blog will cover other stuff besides music, I promise‚Ä¶this post is the fruits of a recent meander into the new ggalt, hrbrthemes and tidytext packages.1
Intro Kanye West is responsible for some of the realest, funniest (‚Äúif you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault‚Äù‚Ä¶asphalt‚Ä¶anyone?) and inspiring lyrics in music. The strength of these words has had a profound effect on me and my generation. Can the application of sentiment analysis techniques help us understand more about his art?</description>

      <title>Vinylspotting: A Discogs Fairytale</title>
      <link>https://ewen.io/2017/03/01/vinylspotting-a-discogs-fairytale/</link>

      <description>At a cursory glance, it‚Äôs almost impossible to get much of an understanding of vinyl record collections beyond their size (or perhaps their age, depending on the smell?). If you get up close, you might recognise some artist names or make out some titles on the spines of LPs, but your average collector is gonna have loads of bits that even they don‚Äôt recognise on sight. Now, while the unadulterated excitement of finding a white label on the shelve that even you can‚Äôt remember is the romance at the very heart of record digging, that thought of forgotten artifacts would send archivists and librarians bonkers.</description>
