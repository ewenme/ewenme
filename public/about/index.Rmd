Analyst / R Developer and data science hopeful in UK government, currently. I'm interested in sharing and supporting opinionated analysis, adventures in R and humane, ethical applications of machine learning.

Otherwise, I'm a collector/selector of dusty records and a player/admirer of The Beautiful Game&trade; (football, Euro-style). Please also hit me up with killer veggie recipes.

image_write(me, path = "images/me.png",format = "png")
