Analyst / R Developer at Transport for London. Trying to understand how cities work, and making them work a bit better for everyone in the process. 

Interested in sharing and supporting opinionated analysis and humane, ethical applications of machine learning.

With the rest of the time, I buy/play dusty records and watch The Breakfast Club (the radio one) and Hot 97 a bit too much.

  image_scale("x600") %>% 
  image_border("#f4f4f4", "20x20")

image_write(me, path = "images/me.png",format = "png")
