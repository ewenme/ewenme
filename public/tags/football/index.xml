      <description>Around this time last year I ran a post on European football transfers, taking in the 2017/18 season’s summer window. I got a bit of an itch to refresh this work when the 2018/19 window hit.

Here, I tell a short story about how this open data was built and showcases some visualisation pieces that utilised that effort.</description>

This constraint has invited increasingly peculiar and precarious market activity over the years, as clubs vie to secure the hottest new talents with varying parts method and madness. Meanwhile, fans lap up newspaper gossip columns and tell friends “he looks quality on YouTube” as they frantically research the latest “wunderkind” their club has been linked with.</description>
