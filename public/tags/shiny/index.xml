      <description>I don’t have much reason to dip in to big data processing tools in my current working capacity. Luckily for me, I have a (self-indulgent) blog now - perfect place to scratch these sorts of itches, and then share the resultant mishaps with the whole world.
I’d recently been working on a Shiny app for increasing visibility and engagement with police violence data. It just so happened that I stumbled across Stanford’s Open Policing Project, with some hefty open data ripe for exploring with big data tools, right after the app’s first build was finished.</description>

      <description>At a cursory glance, it’s almost impossible to get much of an understanding of vinyl record collections beyond their size (or perhaps their age, depending on the smell?). If you get up close, you might recognise some artist names or make out some titles on the spines of LPs, but your average collector is gonna have loads of bits that even they don’t recognise on sight. Now, while the unadulterated excitement of finding a white label on the shelve that even you can’t remember is the romance at the very heart of record digging, that thought of forgotten artifacts would send archivists and librarians bonkers.</description>
