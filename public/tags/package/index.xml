      <description>I made a new R package (ðŸ”¥ðŸ“¦ðŸ”¥) this week. My sophomore post on this site (from way back in March) was a text-based analysis of Kanye West records, which exposed me to the Genius API1 once I wanted to get hold of some lyrical content. In the process, I wrote some functions for playing nicely with this API in R that I knew would probably be handy for others dabbling/wanting to dabble in similar matters.</description>

      <description>I recently authored my first R package (and definitely have the bug, now). It would be remiss of me to continue without a quick PSA for anyone out there thinking about dabbling in the package game - below is a shout-out of the invaluable resources I found along the way that kept me nice and sane.

travis ðŸ’€ https://t.co/dEvM3PWsVb â€” ewen (@ewen_) June 7, 2017   I set out on my package contribution journey by focusing on the development of something that I myself would find useful (that way, I could keep at least one user happy).</description>
