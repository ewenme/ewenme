      <description>Shout-out to the Monday Morning Data Science mailout from John Hopkins. Making my way through this week‚Äôs (#41) edition, I hit upon quite the eulogy concerning a new R package:
 ‚ÄúThe most compelling data visualization libraries I‚Äôve seen in awhile‚Ä¶you have to see it to believe it‚Äù
 You had me at compelling (I‚Äôm not sure who had me exactly, this was the only entry w/o a name attached to it ü§î).</description>

      <description>Introducing geofacet The geofacet package dropped recently (I want to say last week?), a ggplot2 extension allowing for the user to facet plots in a way that can retain an underlying geographical dimension. It perhaps goes a little bit further towards abstraction than tilegrams, but the visualizations we produce can be a bit more complex as well. This post documents my first foray into this packages functionality.1
 Getting to grips with grids If we think about faceting in ggplot2 (facet_wrap, facet_grid), we are already familiar with the idea of placing a sequence of plots into a number of panels, arranged according to a variable(s) of interest.</description>
