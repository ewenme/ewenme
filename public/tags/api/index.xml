      <description>I made a new R package (I understand ðŸ”¥ðŸ“¦ðŸ”¥ is the correct term) this week. My sophomore post on this site (from way back in March) was a text-based analysis of Kanye West records, which exposed me to the Genius API1 once I wanted to get hold of some lyrical content. In the process, I wrote some functions for playing nicely with this API in R that I knew would probably be handy for others dabbling/wanting to dabble in similar matters.</description>
